description = The Strauss J 475, part of the Ghost series of jet fueled adapters, is the result of engineers asking "what if we put fuel in these things?"  Highly paid engineers say that the composite outer tank is slicker than the old metal housing, so drag is reduced.  The J 475 may be attached and used "backward" as well as in the more traditional "forward" orientation, thanks to the more balanced horizontal design of the central pump.
